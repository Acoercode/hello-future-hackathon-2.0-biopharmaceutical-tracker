## Project Overview

BioPharma Tracker is a cutting-edge solution designed to enhance traceability, security, and efficiency within the biopharmaceutical supply chain. Leveraging Hedera Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), our system ensures that every step of a product's lifecycle is securely and immutably recorded, providing complete transparency for all stakeholders.

Our platform utilizes dynamic Master and Child QR codes to enable real-time tracking of biopharmaceutical products from manufacturing to administration. Administrators can generate detailed QR codes for entire batches and individual items, while operators can seamlessly update statuses at each critical stage using intuitive mobile interfaces.

In addition to robust tracking capabilities, BioPharma Tracker features an AI-powered demand prediction tool. This advanced functionality analyzes stock levels, safety thresholds, and manufacturing delays to provide actionable insights, helping organizations make informed decisions about production schedules and inventory management.

By integrating Hedera's high-throughput, secure, and scalable DLT, BioPharma Tracker offers a reliable and transparent solution to combat challenges in the biopharmaceutical supply chain. Our system not only prevents counterfeiting and reduces errors but also ensures that patients consistently receive the medications they need without disruptions.

## Development steps

### QR Code

We began by designing a robust QR code system that enables tracking at both the batch level and the individual item level. This dual-tiered approach allows us to monitor the entire supply chain of biopharmaceutical products while managing the available stock of each pharmaceutical item with precision.

To enhance automation, we established dependencies between these two types of QR codes. For example, when all individual items within a batch are administered, the system automatically updates the batch status to "Administered." This seamless transition facilitates fully automated workflows, ensuring efficiency and accuracy throughout the supply chain process.

### Serverless APIs

We chose to implement all of our APIs using the Serverless framework, taking advantage of its scalability and efficient deployment capabilities. Our API suite includes the **Batches API**, which allows users to list batches, create new batches along with their associated batch items, retrieve specific batch details, view batch activities, access batch QR codes, and obtain trust details for each batch. Additionally, the **Batch Items API** provides functionalities to list individual batch items, retrieve specific item details and activities, access QR codes for batch items, and obtain trust details for each item.

Furthermore, we developed the **Webhook API**, a notification system integrated with the ACOER Data Stamping product that functions as a webhook, triggering notifications whenever data is fully submitted to the Hedera ledger. Our **AI API** encompasses prediction capabilities through the Prediction API and allows retrieval of prediction trust details. All of these APIs are deployed as Lambda functions within the Serverless framework, ensuring a robust, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure for our BioPharma Tracker system.

### AI Integration

In our previous project, we leveraged [H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai/) for our AI and machine learning needs, which provided robust tools for data analysis and predictive modeling. However, for this hackathon, we have chosen to adopt the **o1-mini** model provided by ChatGPT. This decision was driven by the o1-mini model's enhanced performance, superior scalability, and seamless integration capabilities, which are crucial for handling the real-time demand prediction tasks required by BioPharma Tracker.

The o1-mini model offers improved accuracy in forecasting and greater flexibility in adapting to our specific use cases, enabling more reliable insights into supply chain management. While we selected o1-mini for its particular advantages in performance and integration, it is important to note that this AI integration could have been accomplished using any AI provider. Our primary goal remains to utilize the best available tools to ensure that BioPharma Tracker delivers precise and actionable insights for optimizing the biopharmaceutical supply chain.

### Data Stamping in Hedera

As mentioned, we utilize our internal **ACOER Data Stamping APIs** to enhance the security and integrity of our BioPharma Tracker system. By leveraging Hedera's Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), we ensure that all recorded data is immutable and tamper-proof, providing a reliable audit trail for all transactions and operations within the system.

Our Data Stamping implementation is designed with privacy in mind. We have meticulously configured the system to ensure that no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is provided or shared on the ledger. Instead, only essential non-sensitive data is recorded, preserving the confidentiality of sensitive information while maintaining complete transparency and traceability of the supply chain processes. This approach not only safeguards user privacy but also complies with stringent regulatory standards in the biopharmaceutical industry.

This integration allows us to timestamp and verify data entries effortlessly, ensuring that each piece of information is accurately recorded at the exact moment of its creation. By doing so, we provide an additional layer of trust and verification, making it easier for stakeholders to validate the authenticity and chronology of supply chain events and AI predictions.

Overall, the integration of ACOER Data Stamping APIs with Hedera DLT underscores our commitment to building a secure, transparent, and efficient biopharmaceutical supply chain solution. By ensuring data integrity and protecting sensitive information, BioPharma Tracker stands as a trustworthy tool for managing the complexities of the biopharmaceutical industry.

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend of BioPharma Tracker is designed to provide an intuitive and seamless user experience for all stakeholders, including administrators and operators. Built using **React.js**, our user interface offers a responsive and dynamic platform that ensures accessibility across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Leveraging modern frontend technologies, we have created distinct views tailored to the specific needs of different user roles, ensuring that each user can interact with the system efficiently and effectively.

- **Administrator Dashboard:** Administrators have access to a comprehensive dashboard that displays all active batches, detailed tracking information, and AI-driven insights. The dashboard includes interactive elements such as maps for geolocation tracking and clickable Hedera transaction links for verifying DLT proofs. Administrators can also generate and manage Master QR codes, oversee batch activities, and access detailed analytics to monitor supply chain performance.

- **Operator Interface:** Operators interact with the system through a streamlined interface that facilitates real-time status updates and QR code scanning. Using the built-in camera functionality, operators can easily scan both Master and Child QR codes to update the status of batches and individual items at critical stages like manufacturing, quality control, shipping, and administration. The interface provides clear prompts and feedback to ensure accurate and efficient data entry.

- **AI Integration and Insights:** The frontend integrates seamlessly with our AI-powered demand prediction tools, displaying actionable insights and forecasts directly within the administrator dashboard. Interactive charts and dropdown menus allow users to select specific products and view projected stock-out dates, recommended manufacturing restart timelines, and other predictive analytics that aid in proactive supply chain management.

To enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application, we have incorporated **Material-UI** for consistent styling and responsive design components. This ensures that the BioPharma Tracker frontend is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines are set up to streamline updates and maintain high-quality standards, allowing us to deliver a polished and reliable user interface for the biopharmaceutical supply chain management.
